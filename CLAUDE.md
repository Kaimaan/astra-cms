# Astra CMS

AI-first, block-based CMS built with Next.js. Local development works out of the box — no Firebase or API keys needed.

After setup (clone, npm install, npm run dev), read ONBOARDING.md immediately and follow its instructions. It will guide you through building or migrating a site.

Key files:
- `ONBOARDING.md` - AI agent onboarding guide (read this first)
- `astra.config.ts` - Design tokens and site configuration
- `src/blocks/` - Block definitions (schema + renderer)
- `content/pages/` - Page content (JSON)
- `content/site.json` - Site-wide config (header, footer, navigation)
