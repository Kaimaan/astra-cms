# Astra CMS

AI-first, block-based CMS built with Next.js.

When helping users build, customize, or migrate their site, read ONBOARDING.md first.
It contains the complete onboarding flow with two paths: building from scratch or migrating an existing site.

Key files:
- `ONBOARDING.md` - AI agent onboarding guide (read this first)
- `astra.config.ts` - Design tokens and site configuration
- `src/blocks/` - Block definitions (schema + renderer)
- `content/pages/` - Page content (JSON)
- `content/site.json` - Site-wide config (header, footer, navigation)
